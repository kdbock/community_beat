🖼️ 2. Interstitial Ads
Description: Full-screen ads shown at natural break points (e.g., after level completion).

Sizes: Automatically scale to fit device screen (not fixed like banner ads).

Orientation:

Portrait: Matches screen size (e.g., 1080x1920)

Landscape: Matches screen size (e.g., 1920x1080)

✅ Recommended for: High-impact moments, higher revenue per impression.

🎞️ 3. Rewarded Ads (Rewarded Video or Interstitial)
Description: Full-screen video or interactive ad that gives users a reward for watching (e.g., coins, extra life).

Size: Like interstitials, they scale to full screen.

Length: 15 to 30 seconds (most common).

✅ Recommended for: Voluntary engagement, in-app currency, boosts.

🎮 4. Native Ads
Description: Customizable ads that match the look and feel of your app.

Size: Flexible, depends on design — often includes:

App icon/image

Title (25 characters)

Description (90 characters)

CTA (Call-to-Action button)

✅ Recommended for: Feed-based apps, apps with custom UI.

📽️ 5. App Open Ads
Description: Shown when a user opens or switches back to your app.

Size: Full screen, dynamic sizing depending on device.

✅ Recommended for: Monetizing app launches.

🧩 6. Adaptive Banner Ads (AdMob Specific)
Description: A more flexible version of banner ads that adjust to screen size/density.

Size: Height is calculated by the SDK; width is screen width or a developer-defined max.

✅ Recommended for: Modern responsive layouts.

🛠 Tips for Developers
Use Adaptive Banners for better screen coverage across devices.

Rewarded ads have the highest user tolerance and monetization potential.

Never place interstitials during user interaction (e.g., mid-game).

Test on multiple screen sizes to avoid clipping or improper ad display.

Respect Google Play Ad Policy to avoid app suspensions.
